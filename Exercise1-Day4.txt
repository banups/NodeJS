Node is as a leader in the asynchronous framework market. 
The platform now supports a huge portion of startups and businesses that are earning hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. 
Thus, it establishes itself as a platform that can sustain huge load, whilst retaining smooth performance. 
Node.js was perhaps the biggest revelation of modern server engineering that we saw.
By the looks of it, Node isn’t stopping any time soon; it’s the exact opposite. 
The project continues to push out frequent updates, and maintains old releases to support older platforms. 
A new release secures some loopholes in OpenSSL, but also adds more support for languages like C and C++.
Starting with Node.js is a fairly easy process; the guidelines are outlined and thousands of projects are sitting on GitHub, waiting for you to inspect and analyze their architecture. 
Node.js works great on all platforms, even on Windows 10, for those who are interested. That makes it a truly great platform to begin learning front-end and back-end development together.
 Let’s not forget that Node has the most populated package manager of any framework or language known to man.
